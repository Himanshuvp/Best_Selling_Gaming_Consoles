    "    The Best Selling Game consoles of all time is a small but interesting dataset for practicing statistics. We can use the console sells to finally settle the age old question, who is the champion of the console wars. When people talk about the console wars, they mainly are focusing on the home console market. In this notebook, we will go over basic statisical concepts and how to visualize your data. I try to avoid making any assumptions based on my knowledge of the gaming industry and focus solely on the data. We wont go too deep into pandas, numpy or matplotlib functions, but I will do my best to explain the reasoning for why i used certain functions. If you want more information, you should use the documents for these packages.\n",

    "Another way to check the spread of data is by using standard deviation (std). The standard deviation shows the distribution of sells data and how spread out the data is. Standard deviation is actually the same thing as something called variance, execpt it is the square root of variance. For example, Although Sony appears to have higher sales, the standard deviation is the highest, revealing that there may be large inconsistencies in sales. Sega and Coleco have the smallest deviations, showing they may have more consistent track records in sales. Here is the formula for standard deviation:<br><br>\n",

    "Remember x_bar is the mean. All this equation is saying is we are taking the sum all the differences from a console's *units_sold* (x) and the mean (x_bar) squared. We then divide the sum by (n) the number of console units_sold - 1 and take the sqaure root of this result. If we didn't take the square root it would be the variance. The reason we dont divide compleletly by (n) is because this would represent a biased view of the data sampled (known as population sample). So we subtract 1 to get an unbiased estimate of the sample.<br><br>\n",

    "### Nintendo's Sell Consistency\n",
    "This is more of a bonus to show the sells spread across the two main product types for Nintendo: Handheld and Home. Because Hybrid is more of a home console with handheld capabilities, we rename the type as Home. We will use a a violin plot to show the mean and distribution of unit sells for these two device types.<br><br>\n",
    "We can see by the wide width of the violins that most handhelds sold around 60 to 80 million. The thinner the width gets, the fewer consoles have sold in those numbers. This makes sense. Handhelds have always been Nintendos bread and butter, but the Nintendo DS definitely surpassed all previous handhelds by a long shot. This is why the top of the violin is so thin.<br><br>\n",
    "The distribution for the home console is much more consistent. This means the unit sales don't stray far away from the mean.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Sony is the preferred console based on these statistics. Although Sony wins the console wars, Nintendo clearly is the best overall as a company and remains consistent through every decade. Nintendo doesn't have anyone competing with their handheld devices. All in all, this is a great example of using data to come to a satisfactory conclusion about an industry you may not know much about. Seeing the data visually also gives you a better representation of where to focus your anaylsis. Focusing on each decade gave us more insight rather than relying on total sales all together.\n"
