# Best_Selling_Gaming_Consoles
The Best Selling Game consoles of all time is a small but interesting dataset for practicing statistics. We can use the console sells to finally settle the age old question, who is the champion of the console wars. When people talk about the console wars, they mainly are focusing on the home console market. In this notebook, we will go over basic statisical concepts and how to visualize your data. I try to avoid making any assumptions based on my knowledge of the gaming industry and focus solely on the data. We wont go too deep into pandas, numpy or matplotlib functions, but I will do my best to explain the reasoning for why i used certain functions. If you want more information, you should use the documents for these packages.
